Perfect! Since you’re putting all the files in a single folder named `docs`, we can simplify all the links to point there. Here’s a cleaned-up, GitHub-ready README with clickable links:

### Practical Sessions & Resources

This section contains all the files and resources needed for our hands-on practical sessions in the computer lab.

- [Module 1 Practical Exercises (PPT)](docs/practical_exercises.ppt)
- [Practice Data Files (CSV)](docs/practice_data.csv)
```

✅ Key points:

1. All files are now expected in the `docs` folder.
2. No spaces in folder or file paths → no `%20` encoding needed.
3. All links are clickable on GitHub.

If you want, I can also **add a nice table of contents with quick jump links** to each section — it makes the README look more professional and easier to navigate. Do you want me to do that?
